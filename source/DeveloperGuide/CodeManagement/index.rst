==================================
Code Management
==================================

The DIRAC code management is performed using the Git code management system. It relies on the excellent Git
capability for managing code branches which is mandatory for a distributed team of developers. However,
the DIRAC branching model is following strict conventions described in this chapter. Furthermore, the
DIRAC code management is done using the Github service as the main code repository. The Github service
provides also facilities for bug and task tracking, Wiki engine and other tools to support the group code
development.

The DIRAC releases are described using a special configuration file and tools are provided to prepare
code distribution tar archives.
