Web Portal User guide
=====================

DIRAC WebApp project aims to produce the new Web Interface for the DIRAC Project. 
While partially keeping some concepts from the old DIRAC Web interface, it does include some new ideas to make more comfortable your DIRAC experience.
  
The DIRAC Web portal is a user friendly interface which allows user to interact to the DIRAC components. 
It can be easily extended by other VO or it can be integrated to other portal. 
It is developed by taking into account what we learnt using the current web portal.
